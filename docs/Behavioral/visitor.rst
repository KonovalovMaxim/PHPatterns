According to the Gang of Four, the Visitor pattern is a way to "represent an operation to be performed on the
elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements
on which it operates" (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, 2013, p. 331).
