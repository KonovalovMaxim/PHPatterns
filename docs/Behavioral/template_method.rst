Template Method
===============

Intent
------

According to the Gang of Four, the Template Method pattern is a way to "define the skeleton of an algorithm in an
operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm
without changing the algorithm's structure"
(Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, 2013, p.325).
