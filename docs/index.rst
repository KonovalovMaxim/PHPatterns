PHP Patterns Documentation
==========================

I have read the well-known book: `Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns>`_ written by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson and John Vlissides).

In order to practise efficiently I have developed all the patterns shown in the book in PHP language (programming
language used at work).
Each pattern is documented and unit tested using `PHPUnit <https://phpunit.de>`_.
Like the book, it's a catalog of 23 patterns and you should consider it as a basis for learning purposes.

Found a typo? Something wrong with this content? Just let me know and please feel free to contribute!
