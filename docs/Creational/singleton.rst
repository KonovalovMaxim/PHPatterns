Singleton
=========

Intent
------
The purpose of the Singleton pattern is to ensure that a class will only have one instance at any time during code
execution. Another key feature is to provide a global access to that instance.

When to use it?
---------------
For many people (including myself), Singleton is the political and nice name for global variables on object-oriented
programming and that is the main drawback (global access + global state).

Global access makes source code hard to test ! Indeed, each objects should declare its collaborators in the
constructor (dependency injection) in order to be able to mock dependencies.

For more details, I suggest you the great Mi≈°ko Hevery's blog (`The Testability Explorer <http://misko.hevery.com>`_)
and especially these posts:

- `Singletons are Pathological Liars <http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/17/singletons-are-pathological-liars>`_
- `Root Cause of Singletons <http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/25/root-cause-of-singletons>`_

Having said this, a few Singletons may be used inside your application without "harming" it. All objects that do not
affect the behavior of your application (like a Logger) may be perfect examples.
